Machine Learning is indeed the new foundation for running businesses. As you run your business, there is the need for customer retention to provide sustenance to your current business, aside from looking for new customers. For this to happen, a customer churn predictive analysis, or customer churn predictive model, is created.

Customer churn prediction is predicting the number of customers that are likely to withhold consumption of your product, or simply likely to leave your business. We are going to see how we can create a training model that predicts customer churn. Features are created(features refer to the factors that may control the success of the business) and so are labels(labels refer to the data being predicted).

As per the sample question given by *Lux Tech Academy*,

Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that. So, if you oversaw predicting customer churn, how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? What steps would you take to create a machine-learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?

We are going to tackle the measures that Sprint would have to take to predict their customer churn.

First off, Sprint would  have to:

***<mark>1.&nbsp; Understand the Problem at hand;</mark>***

Customer churn would impact the business by reducing the popularity of the company hence the loss of customers. As a telecom company, the features of this predictive model would have to be factors such as network strength/availability, packages offered by the company, and costs of the packages(whether high or low), among others. The label would have to be customer data (the number of customers that Sprint is likely to lose).

The impact of varying the features would have to be looked at too to determine the suitable actions to be taken.

***<mark>2.&nbsp; Data Collection and Preparation;</mark>***

Sprint would have to collect data from the past such as the number of customers who’ve left and the reasons that they left. Patterns would have to be determined and measures taken for this. We will make assumptions for the features that we’ll use to train our predictive model.

***<mark>3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA);</mark>***

Data visualization and analysis are done to understand the patterns and trends that are impacted by the variations in the features. Visualization is typically done by matplotlib library as seen below for linear regression(further details about the training models are discussed below):

```python
from matplot import pyplot as plt
#Create your lines of code dataset below
#Display the plot using the line
plt.show()
```

***<mark>4. Feature Engineering</mark>***

Other features could be listed to widen the scope of prediction. However, caution must be taken to avoid many features as they may introduce “noise” into the model.

***<mark>5. Random Data Splitting</mark>***

The dataset is split randomly to improve the model’s performance. It is split into training and testing sets.

***<mark>6. Model Selection</mark>***

The training model to be used is selected. Sample training models could be linear regression, decision trees, or ensemble algorithms. For our case, we will use linear regression as an example for our Sprint predictive model.

***<mark>7. Model Training</mark>***

The developed model is trained using the split dataset for training. This will be demonstrated further in the example at the end of this article.

***<mark>8. Model Evaluation</mark>***

The model is evaluated as part of testing to determine the accuracy of the predictions made.

***<mark>9. Deployment and Monitoring</mark>***

The model is deployed and integrated into Sprint’s system to predict customer churn and to provide a guide on the steps that Sprint needs to take for customer retention.

**Features that Sprint could consider in the predictive model:**

i) Customer demographics: this would include age, gender, and marital status, among others.

ii) Usage patterns: this would include the monthly usage, peak usage, and the frequency of service usage by the customers.

iii)Billing of services by Sprint: the charges made by the company to offer various telecom services.

iv)Customer satisfaction: normally rated by the customer regarding the ease of accessing customer services.

v)Competitor offers: this would involve how Sprint services would be preferred or ranked with regard to other services offered by other telecom companies.

A sample of the training model can be as shown below:

**Please note the CSV file containing the variables(features) has not been provided. The code uses the sci-kit learn library:**

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Load your dataset (assuming a CSV file)
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_dataset.csv')# this would include the url source for the dataset

# Assume 'Churn' is the target variable (1 for churn, 0 for no churn)
# Select relevant features and the target variable
features = ['age', 'monthly_usage', 'contract_length', 'customer_satisfaction']
target = 'Churn'

X = data[features]
y = data[target]

# Preprocess the data: handle missing values, convert categorical features to numerical, etc.
# For simplicity, let's assume data preprocessing has already been done.

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Create and train the logistic regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print('Accuracy:', accuracy_score(y_test, predictions))
print('Confusion Matrix:\n', confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions))
print('Classification Report:\n', classification_report(y_test, predictions))
```

This predictive model would be integrated into Sprint's system and would serve as a guide for actions that the company would have to take.

Thank you.
